## Thesis Outline

### Introduction  
**Problem Statement:** Introduce the challenge of automated code repair and why it remains difficult for AI. Emphasize the limitations of *passive* learning from static data and the need for *active, agent-driven* learning. For instance, note that even state-of-the-art code models currently solve under 20% of real bug-fix tasks in rigorous benchmarks ([RESOURCES.md](file://file-Ueb2sSQMfTUSqmjjwxQ1Zu#:~:text=%2A%2AKey%20results.%2A%2A%20,to)), underscoring the gap this work aims to address.  

**Purpose and Scope:** Clearly state that the thesis investigates transforming a large language model (LLM) into an *autonomous code debugging agent* through reinforcement learning (RL). Define the scope: focusing on Python code fixes using an agent-in-the-loop approach with *Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)* as the RL algorithm. Outline the intended contributions, such as improved bug-fix success rates and insights into how the *scaffolding* (the agent’s supported tools and context) affects learning. Limit the scope to code repair (with a brief mention that code generation from spec is a secondary exploration if applicable).  

**Research Questions:** List the key research questions driving the project, and provide a brief motivation for each:  
- **RQ1:** Does integrating an agent scaffold into the RL training loop significantly improve automated code repair performance compared to the original non-RL-tuned model? (This asks whether RL fine-tuning yields quantifiable gains over a pretrained model’s baseline performance on bug fixes.)  
- **RQ2:** Does a *minimalist* coding scaffold (basic file navigation and edits) yield better or worse performance than a *heavyweight* scaffold (with rich context like repository mapping and internal reasoning) in RL-based code repair? (This examines the trade-off between a simple, generic toolset vs. an engineered, information-rich environment for the agent – inspired by the “bitter lesson” that less hand-holding might generalize better.)  
- **RQ3:** To what extent do the skills learned through scaffold-in-the-loop RL training generalize beyond the training setting – for example, to fixing bugs in other programming languages or to general code-generation tasks like HumanEval? (This probes whether the RL-trained model simply overfits to the provided scaffold and Python environment, or if it develops more generalizable debugging abilities.)  

*(Optional:)* **Thesis Structure:** (Provide a one-sentence roadmap of the document structure for reader orientation, e.g., “The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows: Introduction… Background… etc.”)

### Background and Related Work  
This section reviews the theoretical background and prior research relevant to RL fine-tuning for program repair. It also defines key concepts and terminology used in the thesis.

**Program Repair with Language Models:** Describe the rise of LLMs in program repair and how they are typically used. Cover prior work on automated bug fixing using sequence-to-sequence models or fine-tuning on bug-fix datasets. Mention the performance of state-of-the-art systems (e.g., OpenAI’s Codex or Code Llama) on code repair benchmarks, and their limitations (such as handling multi-file changes or long debugging sessions). Highlight that traditional *supervised fine-tuning* on bug-fix pairs can achieve decent results but may not fully capture the iterative nature of debugging. Recent projects like *RepairLLaMA* and *Llama-3-SWE-RL* have shown that smaller models can “punch above their weight” via specialized fine-tuning, motivating this work’s focus on RL for further improvements.  

**Reinforcement Learning for LLMs:** Provide an overview of how reinforcement learning has been applied to language models. Introduce **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** as a common algorithm for fine-tuning LLMs (e.g., in RLHF for alignment). Then introduce **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**, the specific algorithm used in this thesis, and explain it in accessible terms. GRPO is a variant of PPO that forgoes a separate value critic network and instead uses grouped sample rewards as a baseline for policy updates ([RESOURCES.md](file://file-Ueb2sSQMfTUSqmjjwxQ1Zu#:~:text=learning%20algorithm%20designed%20to%20boost,By%20eliminating)). This innovation reduces the overhead of RL training while maintaining stability, and it has demonstrated improved reasoning performance in language tasks ([RESOURCES.md](file://file-Ueb2sSQMfTUSqmjjwxQ1Zu#:~:text=computing%20a%20baseline%20from%20grouped,By%20eliminating)). Explain why this is suitable for code repair: the sparse success signals in debugging (a patch either fixes the bug or not) align well with GRPO’s reliance on relative reward ranking ([RESOURCES.md](file://file-Ueb2sSQMfTUSqmjjwxQ1Zu#:~:text=efficiently%20fine,steps%20with%20limited%20feedback%20signals)). In short, RL lets the model *learn by doing*: it generates a solution and receives feedback (a reward), which can drive learning beyond what passive observation can achieve.  

**Agent-in-the-Loop Paradigm:** Define what it means to have an “agent-in-the-loop” for model training. Here, the *agent* refers to the LLM augmented with tools or actions (like reading files, running commands) to interact with a codebase. Discuss the concept of *scaffolding*: an external framework that mediates the model’s interactions with the environment (the code repository in this case). Cite examples of agent frameworks in related work – for instance, OpenAI’s early Codex experiments where the model could execute shell commands, or research platforms like SWE-Bench agents (e.g., OpenHands) that allow LLMs to navigate and modify code. Prior studies have found that giving an LLM such tools can boost its problem-solving abilities (scaffolded agents solved ~1.8× more issues than prompt-only approaches in one benchmark ([RESOURCES.md](file://file-Ueb2sSQMfTUSqmjjwxQ1Zu#:~:text=for%20Rust%20and%20multi%E2%80%91file%20fixes%E2%80%94exposing,to))). However, those gains can depend on context length and complexity of tasks, which is why this thesis examines different levels of scaffold complexity. Clearly define **“lightweight scaffold”** (minimal tool use, e.g., basic file I/O and no elaborate context) versus **“heavyweight scaffold”** (extensive support like repository summaries and reasoning dialogues). This sets the stage for RQ2.  

**Prior Work on RL for Code Repair:** Review any existing research at the intersection of RL and code fixing. This might include recent benchmarks and datasets: for example, *SWE-Bench-Verified* (a Python bug-fix benchmark with human-verified solutions) and its multilingual extension *Multi-SWE-Bench* ([RESOURCES.md](file://file-Ueb2sSQMfTUSqmjjwxQ1Zu#:~:text=,language%E2%80%91diverse%20testbed%20for%20code%E2%80%91repair%20agents)) ([RESOURCES.md](file://file-Ueb2sSQMfTUSqmjjwxQ1Zu#:~:text=%2A%2AKey%20results.%2A%2A%20,to)), as well as the *R2E-Gym* environment which demonstrated that combining test execution with learned reward models can significantly improve an open-source model’s bug-fixing success ([RESOURCES.md](file://file-Ueb2sSQMfTUSqmjjwxQ1Zu#:~:text=,BEST%4026%2A%2A%20on%20SWE%E2%80%91Bench%E2%80%91Verified%E2%80%94closing%20much)). Mention how these works inform the thesis – e.g., R2E-Gym provided a format for representing code-edit trajectories that our method can leverage, and it showed the benefit of richer reward signals ([RESOURCES.md](file://file-Ueb2sSQMfTUSqmjjwxQ1Zu#:~:text=match%20at%20L180%20%7C%20,)). Summarize how our approach differs: we integrate the agent framework *directly* into training (rather than treating the model as a black-box policy), and we specifically explore the effect of scaffold complexity on learning outcomes, a gap in literature.  

*(By the end of Background, the reader should understand the problem context, know important terms (LLM, RL, PPO/GRPO, scaffold), and see how this thesis builds on and differs from prior work.)*

### Methodology  
This section details our experimental approach, including the datasets used, the design of the agent scaffolds, the RL training procedure (with algorithm and hyperparameters), and how we evaluate performance. Every design choice is justified with reasoning (either theoretical or empirical).

**Datasets and Benchmarks:** Describe the data on which the agent is trained and evaluated. The *training environment* is based on **SWE-Gym**, a collection of real GitHub issues with known buggy code and their corresponding fixed patches (the “oracle” solutions). Explain how SWE-Gym provides a variety of programming errors and contexts for the agent to learn from (e.g., single-file vs. multi-file issues, different bug types). For evaluation, introduce **SWE-Bench-Verified**, a benchmark of 500 Python bug-fix tasks with human-verified correct patches (a subset of which overlaps with training tasks, if applicable, and others reserved for testing generalization). Emphasize that the model’s primary test is how many of these issues it can correctly resolve. If additional evaluations are done for RQ3, mention them here too: for example, testing on *HumanEval* (to gauge general code generation ability) and possibly on a subset of *Multi-SWE-Bench* for cross-language generalization (if within scope). Ensure to note any preprocessing or filtering steps (e.g., ensuring no direct data leakage between training and test, standardizing diff formats).  

**Agent Scaffolding Variants:** Explain in detail the two scaffolds compared in this work – the **Minimalist scaffold** and the **Heavyweight scaffold** – and how they are implemented.  
- *Minimalist Scaffold:* This setup provides the model only basic capabilities to interact with the repository, mimicking a simple coder with a text-editor and terminal. For instance, the agent can list files (`ls`), read file contents (`cat`), search for keywords (`grep`), and apply a patch (write changes). No additional context or guidance is given beyond the raw file contents. Describe how this scaffold is lightweight in assumptions: it relies purely on the model’s own code understanding to decide where and how to make changes. (It’s similar in spirit to the OpenAI Codex “sandbox” that allowed code execution and file operations, but without any specialized hints).  
- *Heavyweight Scaffold:* This uses the **Aider** tool (or a similar advanced coding assistant) integrated into the loop. Detail the extra support it provides: for example, **RepoMap** which generates a summary of the repository’s structure and relevant file sections, and an internal chain-of-thought dialogue that helps the agent reason about the bug before making changes. In this scaffold, the model can still perform the same file operations, but it operates with richer context (like suggestions of which files might be relevant, or a running commentary on the bug). This scaffold represents a heavily engineered assistive environment.  
- **Integration into the RL Loop:** Describe *how* the scaffolds are connected to the training process. We implement a custom OpenAI-compatible API server on top of a vLLM backend so that the RL trainer can treat the agent’s actions and the model’s generations in a unified way. In practice, the standard `generate()` call of the model is replaced or wrapped with an agent loop: the model’s output can contain tool commands (e.g., “open file X”), which are executed in the environment, and the resulting observations (file content, etc.) are fed back into the model. This continues until the agent produces a final patch. Both scaffolds plug into this framework – the difference is in how much help the agent gets at each step. Mention asynchronous or parallel capabilities if implemented (our setup allows multiple agent instances to run in parallel on different tasks, which speeds up training). This technical integration is a novel aspect of our method, enabling **multi-step, interactive training** rather than one-shot generation ([PROJECT.md](file://file-Rdd21ch65qEup1cXWnyfvY#:~:text=1.%20%2A%2AMulti,code%20editing%2C%20and%20command%20execution)).  

**Model and RL Training Algorithm:** Identify the base language model used and justify the choice. For example, “We fine-tune a 7-billion-parameter code-focused LLM (Qwen-2.5-Coder model) as the agent, chosen for its strong coding ability and open availability.” If multiple model scales are tested, note that (e.g., experiments with 1.5B, 7B models to see scaling effects, while primarily reporting results on 7B). Next, explain the training algorithm details: we use **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)** as our RL method. In practical terms, this means we maintain a *policy model* (the agent LLM) and we do not use a separate *value model*; instead, after the agent attempts a batch of bug fixes, we compute rewards for each attempt and normalize them across the group of samples to decide which trajectories were better than others ([RESOURCES.md](file://file-Ueb2sSQMfTUSqmjjwxQ1Zu#:~:text=learning%20algorithm%20designed%20to%20boost,By%20eliminating)). Summarize how a training iteration works: the agent generates a patch for a given issue (going through multiple steps if using the scaffold), then a reward is assigned based on the outcome (explained in the next subsection). GRPO then adjusts the model weights to increase the probability of the successful actions and decrease the probability of poor actions, with a KL-divergence penalty to keep the updates stable (preventing the model from deviating too far from its pre-trained distribution). By using GRPO’s grouped baseline, we reduce variance in reward signals and simplify the training pipeline (no need to train a value estimator), which is advantageous given limited feedback data.  

**Reward Design:** Clearly define the reward function used to judge the agent’s output for each task. The reward needs to reflect how well the generated patch solved the bug. In our training, we implement an **outcome-based reward**: after the agent produces a patch, we compare it against the known correct patch (oracle). A simple heuristic is used – for example, a diff-based string similarity or a line-level matching score that measures how many of the correct changes were made. We give a high reward if the agent’s patch matches the oracle exactly (fully correct fix), and a lower or zero reward if not. (If partial credit is awarded for a “mostly correct” patch, explain the scheme). Justify this choice: it provides a clear, sparse signal that is easier to compute than running full test suites, aligning with prior work where a “golden diff” is used as ground truth. Acknowledge that this approach doesn’t reward intermediate steps or partial progress explicitly, but it keeps the reward function straightforward. (If applicable, note that we experimented with or plan to explore test-based rewards in future work, as passing test cases would be an ideal indicator of a correct fix ([PROJECT.md](file://file-Rdd21ch65qEup1cXWnyfvY#:~:text=%23%20Test)), but this was out of scope due to infrastructure/time constraints.) We also ensure the reward is **scaled appropriately** for GRPO/PPO (possibly using a reward normalization or clipping strategy) to stabilize training.  

**Training Hyperparameters:** Provide all key hyperparameters and their rationale. This includes the episode or rollout length (how many actions the agent can take per issue – e.g., limited to 5 file edits per issue to prevent infinite loops), the learning rate for policy updates, the batch size (how many issues are attempted in parallel per update), the GRPO-specific parameters (like the KL divergence regularization coefficient, which controls how strongly we penalize the policy for moving away from the initial model’s behavior, to prevent catastrophic forgetting). Also specify the number of training iterations or total episodes the model was run on (for instance, “we trained for 5,000 issue-solving episodes, which amounted to ~3 epochs over the SWE-Gym dataset”). Mention any techniques used to aid training: e.g., *curriculum learning* (if starting with simpler bugs first), *entropy bonus* to encourage exploration, or early stopping criteria. Justify each choice briefly – for instance, “The learning rate was set to 1e-5 based on preliminary sweeps for stable convergence, and a KL penalty of β=0.1 was used to balance between adapting to rewards and maintaining model knowledge (a common practice in RL fine-tuning of LLMs).” If using the GRPO grouped baseline, note the group size (how many sample trajectories per update to compute the baseline) and why that was chosen (perhaps due to batch size or diversity considerations). Essentially, this subsection should reassure the reader that the training was conducted with careful tuning to ensure fairness and stability.  

**Baseline Methods:** Describe the baseline models we compare against to contextualize the results. The primary baseline is the *original pretrained model* without any RL fine-tuning (this addresses RQ1 by comparison). Additionally, we include a **Supervised Fine-Tuning baseline**: we fine-tuned the base LLM on the same training data (the bug–fix pairs from SWE-Gym) using supervised learning (teacher-forcing on the oracle patches). This allows us to compare our RL approach to a conventional fine-tuning approach on identical data. Provide details of this fine-tuning (for example, training for a similar number of epochs, using a standard cross-entropy loss on generating the correct patch). By evaluating the supervised model on the test benchmark, we can see how far RL might outperform (or underperform) standard fine-tuning. If relevant, also mention any *ablation* baselines: for instance, an RL agent without any scaffold (just generating code fixes in one shot without file manipulation – essentially RL directly on the diff output) if that was tested, or using only one scaffold variant. These baselines ensure that we can attribute performance differences correctly (e.g., is improvement due to RL or just having any fine-tuning at all? Is the scaffold helping or could the model do nearly as well without it?).  

**Evaluation Metrics:** Explain how we measure success on the code repair task in the evaluation phase. The primary metric is **success rate** on the benchmark issues: the percentage of issues for which the model’s generated patch is correct. Define what “correct” means in evaluation – typically, *exact match* to the known patch, or passing all provided test cases for that issue if tests are available. If multiple attempts are allowed (though in our setup, likely the agent produces one solution per issue), clarify if we use any *Pass@k* metric (for example, model can try up to 5 patches and we count if any is correct, similar to how code-generation benchmarks are evaluated). Given that SWE-Bench-Verified issues have a single correct solution, we mainly use exact match success rate. We also report secondary metrics for a deeper analysis: e.g., **diff similarity score** (to capture partial correctness), the **size of patches** (to see if one scaffold tends to produce more minimal fixes than the other), and **time/steps taken** per fix (since a heavy scaffold agent might take more steps to solve an issue, we can measure average number of actions or tokens). For any generalization tests (like HumanEval or cross-language), mention the metrics used there (HumanEval typically uses pass@1 or pass@X on test cases). All metrics are collected objectively; no subjective scoring is involved. We ensure statistical significance where appropriate (e.g., using a large enough sample of issues and possibly reporting confidence intervals or standard deviations for success rates).  

*(By the end of Methodology, the reader should understand exactly how the experiments were set up, what was measured, and be convinced that the approach is sound and choices are justified.)*

### Results  
In this section, we present the experimental findings **without interpretation** – just the factual outcomes in the form of text, tables, and figures. Each subsection corresponds to a set of results, often linked to a specific research question or comparison. (Detailed charts or examples might be referenced in the thesis, but here we’ll outline the content.)

**Training Performance and Convergence:** Start by reporting how the RL training progressed. Provide the training curve of the reward (or success rate) over episodes. For instance, “Figure X shows the average reward per episode increasing over the course of training, indicating the agent learning to fix more bugs over time.” Mention if the training stabilized or continued improving, and whether any early stopping was triggered. If using GRPO, note how quickly it converged relative to expectations. Also report if any interesting observations were made during training – e.g., the heavy scaffold agent might learn faster or slower than the lightweight one initially. This subsection sets the stage by confirming that the RL was effective in training the model to a higher performance than where it started (which addresses RQ1 in part).  

**Overall Code Repair Success:** Present the main quantitative results on the test benchmark (SWE-Bench-Verified). This will likely be a table of success rates for each model variant: the **base model** (no fine-tuning), the **supervised fine-tuned model**, the **RL-trained agent with Minimalist scaffold**, and the **RL-trained agent with Heavyweight scaffold**. If multiple model sizes were experimented with, possibly include those as well (e.g., results for 1.5B vs 7B). The text should highlight the key numbers: “The agent trained with RL achieved a X% success rate, significantly higher than the Y% of the original model.” Also compare against the supervised baseline: “Supervised fine-tuning yielded Z% success, whereas our RL approach achieved X%, indicating a **+/– Δ%** difference.” This directly answers RQ1 (improvement over non-RL model) with evidence, and also lets us see if RL gave an edge over conventional fine-tuning. All results are stated without analysis here, but do note if differences are large or small. If applicable, mention performance on training tasks as well (to check for overfitting: e.g., the RL agent might solve a high percentage of the training issues – which is expected – and we primarily care about test set generalization).  

**Minimal vs. Heavy Scaffold Comparison:** Provide results that address RQ2 by comparing the two scaffolding conditions under RL. This could be a direct side-by-side of success rates: e.g., “The lightweight scaffold agent solved 45% of test issues, whereas the heavyweight scaffold agent solved 47%.” Include any other relevant metrics comparing them: perhaps the average patch length or number of files changed per fix. If the difference in success rate is modest, note that they performed comparably; if one clearly outperforms, state by how much. Also, if the performance difference varies by type of issue, that can be reported: for example, maybe the heavyweight scaffold shines on complex multi-file bugs but offers less benefit on simple one-file bugs. Any such trend can be tabulated or described (e.g., “On issues requiring changes to multiple files, the heavy scaffold agent succeeded in 30/100 cases vs 20/100 for the light scaffold, whereas on single-file issues their success rates were similar.”) Keep the reporting factual. If available, also report the difference in **efficiency**: heavy scaffold might require more steps or have longer runtime per issue – these could be quantitatively compared (for instance, “the heavy agent made on average 3.2 actions per issue, vs 2.1 for the light agent”). This gives a complete picture of trade-offs.  

**Generalization and Out-of-Distribution Results:** Present any evaluation done to answer RQ3. If the model was tested on new contexts like other programming languages or an unrelated task (like HumanEval for code generation), report those outcomes here. For example, “On the HumanEval benchmark, the RL-trained model solved N out of 164 problems (X%), compared to the base model’s Y%.” Or if tested on a subset of Java issues from Multi-SWE-Bench: “When tasked with fixing 50 Java bugs (never seen during training), the agent succeeded in M% of cases.” These numbers show whether the RL training on Python bug fixes improved the model’s general coding ability or if it was narrow. Also, compare these with the baseline model’s performance on the same tasks to see if there’s any uplift. It’s possible the RL model does better on Python but not on other languages – that should be plainly reported. If no separate generalization dataset was used, this subsection may instead report *cross-validation*-like results or the effect on different categories of bugs (e.g., performance on easy vs hard bugs). In any case, include any **additional result tables or figures** that are relevant to how well the learned skills transfer beyond the training distribution.  

**Summary of Key Quantitative Findings:** (Optional short subsection) Summarize the most important numbers from the above in a bulleted list for quick reference. For example:  
- *RL agent (light scaffold)* – **45%** success on SWE-Bench (vs. 20% for base model).  
- *RL agent (heavy scaffold)* – **47%** success on SWE-Bench.  
- *Supervised fine-tune baseline* – **40%** success on SWE-Bench.  
- *Generalization (HumanEval)* – RL agent got **15%** pass@1 (base model 12%).  

(This recap makes it easy for the reader to see the improvements at a glance. This section remains purely factual; interpretation will follow in Discussion.)

### Discussion and Analysis  
This section interprets the results, delves into explanations for the observed outcomes, and relates them back to the research questions and broader context. It also addresses the limitations of the study and any threats to the validity of the conclusions. Subsections are organized by themes corresponding to the RQs and important considerations.

**Impact of RL Fine-Tuning (RQ1):** Discuss how the RL fine-tuning affected the model’s performance relative to the original model. For instance, if the RL-trained agent significantly outperformed the base LLM on the code repair benchmark, interpret what this means: “Integrating the agent into a feedback loop clearly boosted the model’s bug-fixing capabilities, confirming that learning from interactive trial-and-error can yield benefits beyond static training.” Connect this to the nature of the task – the model likely learned strategies to navigate and modify code that it couldn’t infer from static data alone. If the improvement was modest, discuss potential reasons (e.g., the base model was already strong, or the reward might have been too sparse to drive big changes). Also, incorporate the comparison with the supervised fine-tuning baseline here: did RL provide a further edge? For example, “Our RL agent achieved a higher success rate than the supervised baseline, suggesting that optimizing on an interactive objective (with exploratory actions) helped the model capture aspects of the debugging task that a pure imitation approach missed.” On the other hand, if the supervised approach was as good or better, analyze why – perhaps the dataset was clean and learning the direct mapping was sufficient, tying into recent findings that purely maximizing likelihood can rival RL in some settings ([RESOURCES.md](file://file-Ueb2sSQMfTUSqmjjwxQ1Zu#:~:text=All%20Roads%20Lead%20to%20Likelihood%3A,Tuning%20%2A%2ALink%3A%2A%2A%20https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F2503.01067)). In either case, discuss how this result aligns with or contradicts expectations and prior work. This addresses RQ1 by directly stating whether scaffolded RL fine-tuning is effective and to what extent.  

**Effect of Scaffold Complexity (RQ2):** Analyze the differences observed between the minimalist and heavyweight scaffolds. If one scaffold led to better performance: try to explain why. For example, if the heavyweight scaffold agent slightly outperformed, one might attribute it to the richer context (the model had more information, like repository overviews, helping it find relevant code faster). But also consider the nuance: the heavy scaffold might risk information overload or overfitting to the provided hints, whereas the lightweight scaffold forces the model to rely on its general reasoning. If their performances were close, that is an interesting finding in itself – it could imply that sophisticated scaffold aids are not necessary for the model to learn the task (aligning with the “bitter lesson” hypothesis that simpler approaches scale better). Discuss any qualitative differences noticed: Did the heavy scaffold agent produce solutions in a fundamentally different way (e.g., more verbose commit messages or comments due to its dialog integration) than the light one? Also, mention any differences in training stability or speed: perhaps the heavy scaffold, with more steps per episode, made the reward credit assignment harder or training slower. Relate the findings to RQ2 explicitly: e.g., “Our results indicate that the minimalist scaffold was **equally effective** as the heavyweight alternative in terms of final success rate, suggesting that additional engineered context did not significantly improve the learning outcome. This implies that a simpler, less assumption-driven agent can perform on par with a complex tool-augmented agent, at least for the types of bugs in our data.” Alternatively, if the heavy scaffold was better: “the heavy scaffold’s advantage on complex multi-file issues demonstrates that providing domain-specific guidance can enhance learning, though it comes at the cost of more complicated integration.” Tie this back to related work if possible (for instance, the Multi-SWE-Bench finding that scaffolds help up to a point ([RESOURCES.md](file://file-Ueb2sSQMfTUSqmjjwxQ1Zu#:~:text=for%20Rust%20and%20multi%E2%80%91file%20fixes%E2%80%94exposing,to)) could be echoed: our heavy scaffold helped on certain tasks but showed diminishing returns on simpler ones).  

**Generalization and Transfer (RQ3):** Interpret how well the RL-trained agent generalized beyond its training setting. If we saw improved performance on HumanEval or other-language bugs, discuss what that suggests: perhaps the training taught the model a more disciplined problem-solving approach (like systematically reading error messages or understanding code intents) that transfers to unrelated coding tasks. On the other hand, if the model’s gains were mostly confined to the specific type of bugs in SWE-Gym, note that: “The agent excelled in its trained domain but did not show significant improvement on out-of-domain problems, indicating the specialization might be narrow.” This outcome would mean that while the agent learned to fix Python bugs in a certain way, those skills didn’t equate to a generally better coder in all aspects – a caution that RL fine-tuning can overfit to the environment’s specifics (e.g., the format of issues or the workflow of applying diffs). Discuss any evidence of overfitting vs. true skill acquisition: for example, maybe the RL agent did better on Python tasks but actually regressed on HumanEval compared to the base model (hypothetically, if it over-optimized for diff generation at the expense of free-form coding). If generalization was positive but modest, that still suggests some transfer of knowledge (like learning better code reasoning or attention to detail that helps in new tasks). Relate this back to RQ3, acknowledging the extent of generalization observed. You can also compare to expectations from literature: e.g., “This aligns with findings that RL fine-tuning can yield *task-specific* improvements without a guaranteed broad transfer; truly general reasoning might require either more diverse training tasks or different reward schemes.” Ultimately, state whether the research indicates the RL training made the model qualitatively better beyond the training loop or primarily tuned it for that loop alone.  

**Comparison with Supervised Fine-Tuning:** (If not already covered under RQ1 discussion) provide a dedicated reflection on how the RL approach differed from a standard fine-tune. Discuss not just performance, but also *qualitative differences* in the model’s behavior or outputs. For instance, did the RL agent produce smaller or more efficient patches than the supervised model, because it was directly rewarded for correctness and perhaps implicitly for minimal edits? (Our use of a diff-based reward might encourage minimal fixes ([RESOURCES.md](file://file-Ueb2sSQMfTUSqmjjwxQ1Zu#:~:text=%7C%20,report%20on%20SWE%E2%80%91Bench%E2%80%91Verified%2C%20so%20any)), whereas a supervised model might sometimes overshoot changes.) Also mention stability: RL training can be trickier to get right; was it worth it compared to the relatively straightforward supervised training? If both achieved similar results, one might argue the simpler method is preferable unless the RL offers other benefits (like the ability to incorporate non-differentiable feedback or multi-step actions). If RL did better, articulate why RL might capture signals that supervised loss doesn’t – possibly the reward focuses on end-goal success rather than exact imitation, allowing more exploration and creative fixes. This section essentially weighs our RL fine-tuning against the baseline approach in broader terms, which is important for understanding the value added by the research.  

**Error Analysis and Case Studies:** (Optional, but often insightful) Highlight any representative examples of successes or failures to give more insight. For instance, describe a case where the base model failed but the RL agent succeeded – what did the agent do differently? Perhaps the agent navigated to an unusual file that the base model didn’t consider, showing improved exploration. Conversely, note a failure case: are there patterns in issues that the agent still couldn’t solve (e.g., tasks requiring understanding of project-level context or a specific algorithm)? Discuss if the scaffold type influenced the kinds of errors: maybe the light scaffold agent had trouble with very large repositories due to lack of summarization, whereas the heavy scaffold agent sometimes applied incorrect but confident changes guided by its heuristic hints. This qualitative analysis can deepen the understanding of the quantitative results and possibly point to limitations.  

**Limitations:** A frank assessment of the limitations of the study. Acknowledge aspects like:  
- **Scope of Evaluation:** The experiments were mainly on Python and on the specific set of GitHub issues in SWE-Gym and SWE-Bench. Results might not directly generalize to all kinds of bugs or other languages (especially since, for example, C/C++ or other languages might pose different challenges like memory errors which our agent wasn’t trained on).  
- **Computational Constraints:** Note if the model size or training duration was limited by available resources – a larger model or longer training might achieve higher scores, so the absolute performance might be capped by what we could afford to run in a master’s project context.  
- **Reward Function Simplifications:** Our reward of diff similarity is a proxy for correctness and has flaws – e.g., it might give partial credit to an incomplete fix or not distinguish a messy fix from a clean one as long as it matches the diff. This could have guided the model in a suboptimal way at times. We did not use actual code execution in the loop (except as potential future work), which is a limitation because the agent wasn’t directly checking test outcomes during training.  
- **Scaffold Implementation:** The two scaffolds we chose (light vs heavy) represent only two points in a spectrum. The heavy scaffold (Aider) is just one design; a different engineered agent (maybe with even more capabilities or a different approach like search-based planning) could yield different results. Also, integrating the scaffold tightly means the trained policy is somewhat entangled with that interface – changing the scaffold later might require re-training or adaptation.  
- **Evaluation Breadth:** If we didn’t evaluate on certain aspects (like security-related bug fixes or performance issues), mention that those weren’t covered. Also, if our generalization tests were limited (say we only did a small HumanEval check), that’s a limitation – we can’t claim broad general reasoning improvement without more evidence.  

By listing these, we clarify what conclusions can or cannot be drawn from the work. It shows an understanding of the study’s boundaries.

**Threats to Validity:** Discuss any factors that might threaten the validity of the conclusions and how we mitigated them. For example:  
- *Reproducibility:* Did we use randomness (e.g., in environment or model initialization) and how did we ensure results are reliable (perhaps by fixing seeds or running multiple trials)? If the results rely on a single run due to time, acknowledge that as a threat (the agent’s final performance might vary in another run).  
- *Baseline fairness:* Ensure the comparison with the baseline is fair – e.g., the supervised model had the same training time and data. If not, that could threaten the validity of claiming one is better.  
- *Evaluation bias:* We used a particular metric (exact patch match). It’s possible that a patch could be functionally correct but not textually identical to the oracle, causing an underestimation of success. This is a validity concern – the way we measure success might miss some cases, or conversely might give credit to patches that only superficially match. We tried to mitigate this by manual inspection of outputs or by noting the issue.  
- *Generalization claims:* If we claim generalization, note any confounding factors (maybe the model had seen similar patterns in training, or the test isn’t completely independent).  
- *Human factors:* In implementing the heavy scaffold, certain heuristics (like how the RepoMap summarizes code) might inadvertently leak information or biases. We assume they don’t give away the solution, but it’s worth stating that the scaffold was carefully designed not to solve the task for the model, only to assist.  

By addressing these threats, we increase confidence in the results or at least transparently show where caution is needed.

### Conclusion and Future Work  
This final section wraps up the thesis by directly answering the research questions, reflecting on the significance of the findings, and suggesting avenues for future research.

**Conclusions:** Summarize the outcomes of the thesis in direct reference to the RQs:  
- **RQ1 (Effect of RL with scaffold):** Provide a concise answer, e.g., “Yes – the integration of an agent scaffold with RL training substantially improved code repair performance over the base model. The RL-tuned agent fixed roughly double the number of bugs that the pretrained model could, validating the benefit of learning from interactive feedback.” (Include specific percentage improvements or key stats from results to back this up.) If the improvement was modest or conditional, state that nuance: “The RL agent showed a moderate improvement of +5% in success rate over the base model; this demonstrates some benefit, though not dramatic, possibly due to the already strong initial model.”  
- **RQ2 (Light vs Heavy scaffold):** Answer which scaffold was more effective, or state that they were comparable. For example, “The lightweight scaffold performed on par with the heavyweight scaffold, suggesting that simpler tool interfaces can be as effective for training code repair agents.” Or if one was better: “The heavyweight scaffold provided a slight edge in performance (especially on complex tasks), indicating that rich contextual assistance can improve results, though the gain may not justify the added complexity in all cases.” Tie this into the broader implication: either supporting the idea that minimal assumptions are sufficient (which is encouraging for scaling to different domains), or noting that careful tool design can yield improvements.  
- **RQ3 (Generalization):** State how well the agent’s skills transferred. For instance, “We found that the RL-trained agent’s improvements mostly remained within the training domain (Python bug fixes). There was only minimal gain on unrelated tasks, implying the specialization did not broadly generalize.” *Or,* “Interestingly, the agent exhibited slight improvements on general coding tasks like HumanEval, hinting that the reinforcement learning may have imparted better problem-solving strategies beyond the specific environment.” In either case, be cautious not to overgeneralize – make it clear what the evidence supports.  

After addressing RQs, provide a short holistic take-home message: for example, “In summary, this thesis demonstrates that making an LLM an *active participant* in the debugging process via reinforcement learning can lead to more effective and potentially more **robust bug-fixing models**. It also sheds light on the role of environmental support (scaffolds): more isn’t always better, and even minimal tool use enabled significant learning. These findings contribute to the understanding of how best to fine-tune large models for complex tasks with feedback.” Ensure the tone is confident but measured, highlighting contributions without exaggeration.

**Future Work:** Suggest logical next steps and improvements, building on the limitations and insights of this research:  
- *Enhanced Reward Signals:* One important extension is to incorporate **test-case execution for rewards**. Instead of relying on diff similarity, future training could run the project’s test suite after each attempted fix and reward the agent for actually passing tests (functional correctness). This would align the training signal even more directly with real bug-fixing success. As noted in our design, this requires more computational resources and engineering (possibly running in a distributed setup ([PROJECT.md](file://file-Rdd21ch65qEup1cXWnyfvY#:~:text=,strategies%20that%20still%20satisfy%20requirements))), but could make the agent’s learning more general (since there can be many correct solutions, not just the oracle patch).  
- *Scaling to More Languages and Domains:* Expanding the approach to multiple programming languages (using datasets like Multi-SWE-Bench’s tasks in Java, JavaScript, C, etc.) would test the generality of agent-in-the-loop RL. It would be interesting to see if the minimalist vs heavyweight scaffold conclusion holds in other ecosystems, or if certain languages benefit more from certain tools (e.g., statically typed languages might benefit from compiler feedback as part of the scaffold). Additionally, tackling different types of code modifications (performance optimizations, security vulnerability patches) could broaden the applicability.  
- *Larger Models and Efficiency:* Trying this approach with larger base models (or even training from scratch with RL, as extreme as done in DeepSeek-R1 ([RESOURCES.md](file://file-Ueb2sSQMfTUSqmjjwxQ1Zu#:~:text=This%20work%20presents%20a%20multi,built%20on%20Qwen%20and%20Llama)) ([RESOURCES.md](file://file-Ueb2sSQMfTUSqmjjwxQ1Zu#:~:text=backbones%29.%20DeepSeek,reasoning%20in%20tasks%20like%20code))) could show how far we can push the performance. Our work used up to ~7B parameter models; scaling to 30B or beyond might significantly improve raw success rates, and it would test if our findings about scaffold complexity still hold at scale. Conversely, investigating model distillation (compressing the learned policy into a smaller model for deployment) would be valuable if we aim for practical, lightweight bug-fixing agents.  
- *Hybrid Approaches:* Future work might explore combining the strengths of both scaffold types – for example, a scaffold that is generally minimalist but can invoke a “helper” module for complex analysis when needed (adaptive scaffolding). Another idea is to use the heavy scaffold during training to quickly teach the model, then see if the model can operate with a lighter scaffold at test time, thus getting the best of both worlds.  
- *Improving Exploration and Safety:* In RL, especially with code, ensuring the agent explores diverse solutions without damaging the environment (e.g., not deleting important files) is crucial. Future research could integrate safeguards or better exploration strategies (like curiosity-driven rewards for exploring new files) to further improve learning.  
- *User Study or Human-in-the-Loop:* While our work is fully automated, an interesting extension is to involve human feedback – for instance, a human could rank the quality of patches or intervene when the agent is stuck. This could lead to a human-in-the-loop training that might refine the agent’s capabilities in more nuanced ways (akin to how ChatGPT is fine-tuned with human feedback, but here for code quality preferences).  

Conclude the future work section by noting that these directions can build upon the foundation laid by this thesis. Reiterate that as software debugging remains a critical and complex challenge, empowering LLMs with more **agentic, learning-by-doing abilities** is a promising path forward. The insights from this thesis – on reward design, scaffold roles, and generalization – serve as stepping stones for the community to develop more effective autonomous coding assistants in the future.
