# Project Planning

This document tracks weekly progress, supervisor feedback, and tasks for my thesis project. Weeks ordered in decending order.

## March 3 - March 9, 2024

### Checkpoint: Monday, March 3, 2024

#### Supervisor Updates
- Notes from meeting:
  - I need to scope out my project more, decide what task I am optimizing for exactly
  - Is that code execution RL? 
  - Will I be doing a ML paper? Data curation and cleaning paper / agentic coder paper?
  - Am I targeting SWE-Bench? RepairBench?

#### Tasks
- [ ] Scope out my project
- [ ] Look at how SWE-Bench works exactly, should we train for that behavior end2end?
- [ ] Fix SLURM scripts (get a basic training run going)

#### Thoughts
- Should I keep on using GRPOTrainer?
- Should I fork verifiable envs or create my own (execution consideration)
