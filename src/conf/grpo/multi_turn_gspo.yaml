# GSPO with no modifications and our custom Liger Kernel
loss_type: grpo  # needs to be this value to actually work as GSPO

generation_batch_size: 8
per_device_train_batch_size: 4  # "default" runs have 2 training GPUs, 2x4=8

num_iterations: 1  # we cache the generated rollouts and update on them twice (this enables the clipping)

# GSPO describes having no KL, but a small beta helps stabilize our multi-turn / long context runs
