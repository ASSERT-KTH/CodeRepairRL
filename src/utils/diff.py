1. In the `calculate_total` function, you need to handle the case where an item might not have a price attribute.

```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def calculate_total(items):
    # Calculate the total price of items
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        total += item.price
    return total
=======
def calculate_total(items):
    # Calculate the total price of items
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        # Handle items that might not have a price attribute
        if hasattr(item, 'price'):
            total += item.price
        elif hasattr(item, 'get_price'):
            total += item.get_price()
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Item {item} has no price information")
    return total
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

2. The ShoppingCart class should apply a discount when calculating the total:

```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def get_total(self):
        # Calculate total price
        total = 0
        for item in self.items:
            total += item.price
        return total
=======
    def get_total(self, discount=0):
        # Calculate total price with optional discount
        total = 0
        for item in self.items:
            total += item.price
        
        # Apply discount if provided (as a percentage)
        if discount > 0:
            total = total * (1 - discount/100)
            
        return total
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

3. The receipt formatter needs to handle discounts and show item quantities. Here's a unified diff:

```diff
@@ -1,12 +1,19 @@
-def format_receipt(cart, customer_name):
+def format_receipt(cart, customer_name, discount=0):
     # Format a receipt for the customer
     lines = []
     lines.append(f"Receipt for {customer_name}")
     lines.append("-" * 30)
     
+    # Group items by name and count quantities
+    item_counts = {}
     for item in cart.items:
-        lines.append(f"{item.name}: ${item.price:.2f}")
+        if item.name in item_counts:
+            item_counts[item.name][0] += 1
+        else:
+            item_counts[item.name] = [1, item.price]
+    
+    for name, (quantity, price) in item_counts.items():
+        lines.append(f"{name} x{quantity}: ${price * quantity:.2f}")
     
     lines.append("-" * 30)
-    lines.append(f"Total: ${cart.get_total():.2f}")
+    lines.append(f"Total: ${cart.get_total(discount):.2f}")
+    if discount > 0:
+        lines.append(f"(Includes {discount}% discount)")
     
     return "\\n".join(lines)
```

These changes will make your code more robust and add the discount functionality to the shopping cart.
